# ðŸŽ®Hangman gameðŸŽ®

   The origins of the game are unclear but could stretch back to the 1890s. Players guess letters of an unrevealed word and then draw an arm, leg, head or torso of a stick figure hanging from gallows for every incorrect guess. If players draw all body parts and the word still hasn't been spelled out, the players lose.
